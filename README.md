## Pebble App :: Meditation

This is an app for the [Pebble Smartwatch][1]. 

This is a simple timer app designed to help people keep track of their meditation session. You provide a duration and an interval, and it will countdown, vibrating at each designated interval.

The idea for this app came from by user *JamesMeacham* on the [offical Pebble forums][2].

### Install

You can install this watchface by clicking [this link][3] on the Android or iOS device that you have paired to your Pebble watch.

The app is also available to [download on MyPebbleFaces][4].
